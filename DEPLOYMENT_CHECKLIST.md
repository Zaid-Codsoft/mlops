- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for code quality created
- [ ] Code quality workflow tested
- [ ] All Python files pass flake8 checks

### 3. Unit Testing Setup
- [ ] Unit tests written for Flask application
- [ ] Unit tests written for model training
- [ ] Unit tests written for helper functions
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for unit tests created
- [ ] Test coverage requirements met (>80%)

### 4. Flask Application
- [ ] Flask app created with prediction endpoint
- [ ] HTML template for user interface created
- [ ] Model training script created
- [ ] Health check endpoint implemented
- [ ] Error handling implemented

### 5. Docker Configuration
- [ ] Dockerfile created
- [ ] .dockerignore file created
- [ ] Docker image builds successfully
- [ ] Container runs without errors
- [ ] Health check works in container

### 6. Jenkins Setup
- [ ] Jenkins installed and configured
- [ ] Required plugins installed
- [ ] Docker Hub credentials configured
- [ ] Jenkinsfile created
- [ ] Pipeline job created and configured

### 7. Email Notifications

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telco-churn-prediction.git
cd telco-churn-prediction

# Create and switch to dev branch
git checkout -b dev
```

### Step 2: Test Code Quality
```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# Test comment" >> app.py
git add app.py
git commit -m "Test code quality workflow"
git push origin dev
```

**Expected Result:** GitHub Actions should trigger and run flake8 checks.

### Step 3: Test Unit Tests
```bash
# Create PR to test branch
git checkout test
git merge dev
git push origin test
```

**Expected Result:** GitHub Actions should trigger and run unit tests.

### Step 4: Test Full Pipeline
```bash
# Create PR to master branch
git checkout master
git merge test
git push origin master
```

**Expected Result:** Jenkins pipeline should trigger and deploy to Docker Hub.

## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Code Quality Verification
- [ ] Check GitHub Actions tab for successful workflow runs
- [ ] Verify flake8 reports are generated
- [ ] Confirm no PEP 8 violations

### 2. Unit Tests Verification
- [ ] Check GitHub Actions tab for successful test runs
- [ ] Verify test coverage reports are generated
- [ ] Confirm all tests pass

### 3. Jenkins Pipeline Verification
- [ ] Check Jenkins dashboard for successful builds
- [ ] Verify Docker images are pushed to Docker Hub
- [ ] Confirm staging deployment is accessible
- [ ] Check email notifications are received

### 4. Application Verification
- [ ] Access staging URL: http://localhost:8080
- [ ] Test health endpoint: http://localhost:8080/health
- [ ] Test prediction endpoint with sample data
- [ ] Verify model info endpoint works

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Code Quality Failure
1. Add a line with PEP 8 violation to `app.py`
2. Push to dev branch
3. Verify GitHub Actions fails
4. Fix the violation
5. Push again and verify success

### Scenario 2: Unit Test Failure
1. Modify a test to make it fail
2. Push to test branch
3. Verify GitHub Actions fails
4. Fix the test
5. Push again and verify success

### Scenario 3: Full Pipeline Test
1. Make a valid change to the code
2. Push through dev ‚Üí test ‚Üí master
3. Verify each stage works correctly
4. Confirm final deployment and notification

## üìä Success Metrics

### Code Quality Metrics
- [ ] 0 PEP 8 violations
- [ ] Code complexity < 10
- [ ] All files pass flake8 checks

### Test Metrics
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] No test failures

### Deployment Metrics
- [ ] Docker image builds successfully
- [ ] Container starts without errors
- [ ] Application responds to health checks
- [ ] Email notifications sent successfully

## üö® Rollback Plan

### If Code Quality Fails
1. Fix PEP 8 violations
2. Push corrected code
3. Verify workflow passes

### If Unit Tests Fail
1. Fix failing tests
2. Update test coverage
3. Push corrected code

### If Jenkins Pipeline Fails
1. Check Jenkins logs
2. Fix configuration issues
3. Re-run pipeline
4. Verify deployment

### If Application Fails
1. Check container logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test locally
4. Redeploy if necessary
